Investment Strategy  \nThe investment objective of the Scheme is to provide long -term capital appreciation by investing \npredominantly in Large-Cap companies. \n \nThe Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 80% to Large - Cap stocks. The Scheme may \nalso invest upto 20% of AUM in debt and money market securities. The Scheme will remain \ndiversified across key sectors and economic variables. \n \nThe Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for \ndiversification and subject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time. \n \nSubject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock \nLending activities. \n \nInvestment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their \noutlook. \n \nThe Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF) \nRegulations. \n \nAs part of the F und Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as \nfutures and options, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible \nin future under applicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Sch eme shall be for \nrestricted purposes as permitted by the regulations.  \n \nFor detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI.  For exposure limits to derivatives, refer \nsection ‘Where will the scheme invest’ under Section II, Part II, Clause A in the SID. \n \n \n \n \n \n6  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \n \n \nThough every endeavour will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the \nAMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be \nachieved. No guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. \n \n8. Risk Profile of the Scheme \nMutual Fund Units involve investment risks including the possible loss of principal. Please read the \ndetails on risk factors carefully before investment. Scheme specific Risk Factors are summarized \nbelow: \n(i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \n● Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a \ndaily basis. Investments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk \nand investors should not invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. \n● Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and \ncarry a larger amount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the \nexchanges. Investment in such securities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.  \n● While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell \nthese investments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may \nlead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security is finally sold. \n● Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments \nheld in the debt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. \n \n(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \n• The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money \nMarket instruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The \nNAV of the Scheme is expected to increase fro m a fall in interest rates while it would be \nadversely affected by an increase in the level of interest rates. \n• Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed secondary market, \nwhich may restrict the selling ability of the Scheme and m ay lead to the Scheme incurring \nlosses till the security is finally sold. \n• Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term \nrating of the issuers. \n• Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit  risk or default (i.e. \nthe risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or \nany other issues, which may have their credit ratings downgraded. Changes in financial \nconditions of an issuer, changes in economic and political conditions in general, or changes \nin economic or and political conditions specific to an issuer, all of which are factors that \nmay have an adverse impact on an issuer's credit quality and security values. This may \nincrease the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will endeavour to manage credit \nrisk through in-house credit analysis. \n• Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its \nsecurities before their maturity date, in periods of declining inter est rates. The possibility of \nsuch prepayment may force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in \nsecurities offering lower yields, resulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. \n \n \n \n7  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \n• Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received \nfrom the securities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment \nis the \"interest on interest\" component. The risk is that the rate at which interim cash flows \ncan be reinvested may be lower than that originally assumed. \n• Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement \nperiods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. \nDelays or other problems in settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods \nwhen the assets of the Scheme are uninvested and no return is earned thereon. The \ninability of the Scheme to make intended securities purchases, due to settlement problems, \ncould cause the Scheme to miss certain investment  opportunities. Similarly, the inability to \nsell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the absence of a well  developed and \nliquid secondary market for debt securities, may result at times in potential losses to the \nScheme in the event of a subs equent decline in the value of securities held in the \nScheme's portfolio. \n• Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price -risk like any other fixed \nincome security. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall  \nand when interest rates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a \nfunction of the existing coupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level \nof interest rates. The new level of interest rate is determined by  the rates at which \ngovernment raises new money and/or the price levels at which the market is already \ndealing in existing securities. The price -risk is not unique to Government Securities. It \nexists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Sec urities are unique in the \nsense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced \nonly by movement in interest rates in the financial system. \n• Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the \nScheme Information Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the \nScheme risk may increase or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e .g. \ncorporate bonds carry a higher level of risk than Government securities. Further even \namong corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are comparatively less risky than AA rated \nbonds.  \n• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest in lower rated / \nunrated securities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer \nattractive yields. This may increase the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \n• As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to  the holder of the \nsecurity, these securities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to \nissuer default risk. Therefore, the interest rate risk of zero  coupon securities is higher. The \nAMC may choose to invest in zero coupon securit ies that offer attractive yields. This may \nincrease the risk of the portfolio. Zero coupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations \nthat do not entitle the holder to any periodic payment of interest prior to maturity or a \nspecified date when the securit ies begin paying current interest and therefore, are \ngenerally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount depends on the \ntime remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. It \nalso varies dependi ng on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the \nperceived credit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are \ngenerally more volatile than the market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. \n \n(iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities: \n Except for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in \nsecurities which are not listed on a stock exchange (“unlisted Securities”) which in general \n \n \n \n8  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \nare subject to greater price fluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than  those which are \ntraded in the open market. Unlisted debt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and \nthere can be no assurance that the Scheme will realise their investments in unlisted \nsecurities at a fair value.  \n• Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value \nhigher than rated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer -specific developments. \nSuch investments display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a \ndeteriorating economic environment. The market values for unrated investments tends to \nbe more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. \n \n(iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement \n(CE) rated securities \n The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in \naddition to the risk factors associated with debt instruments. \n• Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit \nenhancement for the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could \nbe in various forms and could include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter of comfort, etc. \nfrom another entity. This entity could be either related or non -related to the  issuer like a \nbank, financial institution, etc. Credit enhancement could include additional security in form \nof pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, etc. SO transactions are asset backed/ \nmortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by hypo thecation of car loan \nreceivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables etc. Hence, for \nCE rated instruments evaluation of the credit enhancement provider, as well as the issuer \nis undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan \npools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \n•  Liquidity Risk: SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit \nenhancements. Debt securities lack a well -developed secondary market in India, and due \nto the credit enhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, \nthe liquidity in the market for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar \nrated debt instruments. Hence, lower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of \nthe scheme to sell such debt instruments and generate liquidity for the scheme or higher \nimpact cost when such instruments are sold. \n•  Credit Risk:  The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the \ncombined strength of the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the \nissuer or the structure could have an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The \nweakness in structure could arise due to inability of the investors to enforce the structure \ndue to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the underlying collateral or enforce \nguarantee, etc. In case of SO transactions, comingling risk and risk of servicer increases \nthe overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, apart from \nissuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to  structure related credit \nrisk. \n \n(v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo \n The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the \nClearing Corporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government \nsecurities and in Tri -party Repo trades are settled centrally through the in frastructure and \nsettlement systems provided by CCIL; Thus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks \n \n \n \n9  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \nconsiderably for transactions in the said segments. The members are required to contribute an \namount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the  default fund maintained by CCIL as \na part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in case of default by any \nmember in settling transactions routed through CCIL). \n As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to \nthe default fund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post \nutilization of CCIL's contribution if there is a residual loss, it is appropriated from the default \nfund contributions of the non -defaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the \ninitial margin and default fund contribution being invoked in the event of failure of any \nsettlement obligations. In addition, the fund contribution is allowed to be used to meet the \nresidual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting member). \n CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with \na view to meet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo t rades \nand the other for meeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo \ntrades. The mutual fund is exposed to the extent of its contribution to the default fund of CCIL, \nin the event that the contribution of the mutual fund is c alled upon to absorb settlement/default \nlosses of another member by CCIL, as a result the scheme may lose an amount equivalent to \nits contribution to the default fund. \n \n(vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \n●  Currency Risk: \n Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that \nthe assets of the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the \nIndian Rupee equivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected \nby changes in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \n● Interest Rate Risk: \n The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co -related, \ncan differ significantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the \nScheme stand exposed to their interest rate cycles. \n● Credit Risk: \n Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet \ninterest and principal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness \nof the issuer. This is substantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate \ninvestments only in debt instruments with rating not below investment grade by \naccredited/registered credit rating agency. \n● Taxation Risk: \n In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional \nInformation (SAI) under section “ Special Consideration”, Investment in Foreign Securities \nposes additional challenges based o n the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. \nThe scheme may be subject to a higher level of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual \ntaxation. \n The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from \nits investment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the \n \n \n \n10  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \nchanging / evolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme invests. All \nthese may entail a higher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, trans action costs, fees etc. \nthus adversely impacting its NAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \n● Legal and Regulatory Risk: \n Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely \naffect it. If any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or \nregulations should be enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors \nmay be subject could differ materially from current requirements and may materially and \nadversely affect the Scheme and the investors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also \nbe imposed retrospectively. \n● Country Risk: \n The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the \nrisk encompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might \nadversely affect foreign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include \nevents such as introduction of extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi -\nlateral conflict leading to immobilisation of the overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax \nlaws of the respective jurisdiction for execution of trades or otherwise.  \n● To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund \nmay use derivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance \nwith conditions as may be stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \n \n• Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities:  \nIn case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme  provided by \nregulatory bodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in \npermissible Overseas Securities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. \n \n(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives  \n● The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in \nan attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative \nproducts are specialized instruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis \ndifferent from those associated with s tocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an \nunderstanding not only of the underlying instrument but of the derivative itself. Other risks \ninclude, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability of derivatives to correlate \nperfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \n● Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well \nas disproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the \nability of the fund manager  to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the \nstrategies to be pursued by the fund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund \nmanager may not always be profitable. No assurance can be given that the fund manager will \nbe able to identify or execute such strategies. \n● The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the \nrisks associated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \n● Credit Risk: \n \n \n \n11  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \n The credit r isk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its \nobligations and is generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative \ntransaction. \n● Market Risk: \n Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \n● Illiquidity risk: \n This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due \nto lack of liquidity in the market. \n \n Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate  \nFutures (IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio  and \nthe IRF contract used to hedge part of the portfolio  leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the \nportfolio may not exactly match the gain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. \n \n(viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares \n● Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of \npayment of Dividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non -\ncumulative preference shares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on pr eference \nshares in case of inadequate profits in any year. \n● Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and \nthus we may be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. \n● Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than \nsecured and unsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is \nsignificant risk of capital erosion in case the company goes into liquidation. \n \n(ix) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending  \n As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, \nincluding the risk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply \nwith the terms of the agreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme \nand the approved intermediary. Such failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the \ncollateral put up by the borrower of the securities, the inability of the approved  intermediary to \nreturn the securities deposited by the lender and the possible loss of any corporate benefits \naccruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved intermediary. The \nscheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity & loss \nof opportunity. \n \n(x)  Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt \n The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not \nrepresent that the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \n● Limited Liquidity & Price Risk \n There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This \ncould limit the ability of the investor to resell them. \n \n \n \n12  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \n● Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk \n The Credit Enhancement stipulated represents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These \nCertificates represent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not \nrepresent an obligation of either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any \naffiliate of the Seller, Issuer and Originator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate \nHolders against the Investors' Representative. Delinque ncies and credit losses may cause \ndepletion of the amount available under the Credit Enhancement and thereby the Investor \nPayouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the amount available in the Credit \nEnhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent default of an Obligor to \nrepay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess and sell the Asset. However, many factors \nmay affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required to \nrealise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold \nmay be lower than the amount due from that Obligor. \n● Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs \n In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in teno r and yield. Also, \nany Charge Offs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates \n(PTCs). \n● Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility \n If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an inve stor \ncould experience losses or delays in the payments. \n● Risk of Co-mingling \n With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the \nObligors into the Collection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by \na Servicer and depositing the same into the Collection account especially considering that \nsome of the collections may be in the form of cash. In this interim period, collections from the \nLoan Agreements may not be segregated from other funds of o riginator. If originator in its \ncapacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, the Investors may be exposed to \na potential loss. \n \n(xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) \n Perpetual Debt instruments  are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their \ncapital profile. Some of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for \nBasel III Capital Regulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are \nno regulatory guidelines for issuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds \nas per guidelines issued by RBI. The instruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is \nno fixed maturity date.  The key risks associated with these instruments are highlighted below: \n Key Risk Factors: \n - Risk on coupon servicing \n  Banks \n  As per the terms of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel \ndistributions/ payment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable \nreserves and surpluses or inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow \nbanks to make payment of coupons. \n  NBFCs \n \n \n \n13  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \n  While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can \nalso be deferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of \ncapital ratios. \n  Corporates \n  Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon \nis usually cumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the origin al coupon \nrate of the PDI. \n - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity \n  Banks \n  As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity \nTier-1 (CET-1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT -1 bonds can get \nwritten down. Further, AT -1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common \nequity, at the discretion of RBI, in the event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV \nis a point, determined by RBI, when a bank is deemed to have become non -viable unless \nthere is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT -1 Bonds or a public sector capital injection \nhappens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector injection of capital. \nThis risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. \n - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer \n  Banks \n  The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified \nperiod from the date of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the \nbank does not  exercise the call on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the \ninstruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date.   \n \nNBFCs \nThe NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as \nper the regulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the \nRBI guidelines. However, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may \nhave to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call exercise date. \n \n  Corporates \n  There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the \ncall option, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call \nexercise date. \n \n(xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling \n Short-selling is the  sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. \nInstead, he borrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the \nstock he shorted and returns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock c orrects, \nShort seller can buy the stock back for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the \ndifference between higher short sale price and the lower purchase price).If the price of stock \n \n \n \n14  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \nappreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Shor t positions carry the risk of losing money \nand these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price increases without limit and shall \nresult into major losses in the portfolio. \n \n(xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \n● Price Risk: \n Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a \ndaily basis owing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in \ngeneral market conditions, factors and forces affecting capital  market, Real Estate and \nInfrastructure sectors, level of interest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer \nprocedures. \n● Interest Rate Risk: \n Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates \nrise, prices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. \n● Credit Risk: \n Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest \npayment or even on paying back the principal amount on maturity. S ecurities/ Instruments of \nREITs and InvITs are likely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not \nnecessarily be pre scheduled. \n● Liquidity Risk: \n This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There  is \nno assurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there \nwould be time when trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of \nilliquid units may reflect a discount from the market price of comparable s ecurities/instruments \nfor which a liquid market exists. As these products are new to the market they are likely to be \nexposed to liquidity risk. \n● Reinvestment Risk: \n Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there \ncould be repatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, \netc. Consequently, the proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \n● Legal and Regulatory Risk \n The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs \ncomprises a relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and \nenforcement by regulators and courts involves uncertainties. Presently,  it is difficult to forecast \nas to how any new laws, regulations or standards or future amendments will affect the issuers \nof REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. Furthermore, no assurance can be given that the \nregulatory system will not change in a way  that will impair the ability of the Issuers to comply \nwith the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively or make distributions. \n \n(xiv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities \n \n In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with \nthe seller agreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than \nthe original sale price, the difference effectively represent ing interest. A repo in corporate debt \nsecurities is economically similar to a secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt \n \n \n \n15  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \nsecurities as collateral to protect against default. Some of the risks associated with repo in \ncorporate debt are given below: \n Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to \nbuy back securities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter \n(OTC) repo trades, the investment manager will endeavo ur to manage counterparty risk by \ndealing only with counterparties having strong credit profiles. Also, the counter -party risk is to an \nextent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in value to the transaction after knocking off a \nminimum haircut on the  intrinsic value of the collateral. In the event of default by the repo \ncounterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. In case the repo \ntransaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may also  \nprovide settlement guarantee. \n \n Collateral Risk : Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to \nmeet the repo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo \ntransactions only in corporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, \nto address the risk related to reduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral \ndue to credit rating downgrade, the repo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the \nrepo agreement or call for fresh margin to meet the minimum haircut requirement or call for \nreplacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, the investment manager may apply a \nhigher haircut on the underlying security than required as per RBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the \nilliquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To mitigate the risk of price reduction \ndue to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be monitored on a daily basis by \nconsidering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The fund manager or the \nexchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a prespecified \nperiod. If the counterparty is not able to top -up either in form of  cash / collateral, it would \ntantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be \nrecovered by sale of collateral. \n \n(xv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes \n \n1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. \nAny change in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will \naffect the performance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes.  \n \n2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads. \n \n(xvi) General Risk factors \n• Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the \ninvestments made by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have \ndifferent settlement periods and such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen \ncircumstances leading to delays in receipt of proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the \nUnits of the Scheme can go up or down bec ause of various factors that affect the capital \nmarkets in general. \n• As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading \nvolumes and settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units \nmay be significant in the event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or \nrestructuring of the Scheme. In view of the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole \ndiscretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending redemptions) under cer tain \n \n \n \n16  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \ncircumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption and / or Suspend \nRedemption of the units. \n• At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be \nable to invest in securities falling within it s investment objective resulting in holding the monies \ncollected by it in cash or cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / \ninvestments amounting to substantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The \nScheme may retain certain investments in cash or cash equivalents for its day -to-day liquidity \nrequirements. \n• Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance \nbetween the portfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark part icularly over a short to \nmedium term period. \n• Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, \nwhich may include changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies.    \n• The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset -\nliability mismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of \nthe securities leading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in \nlower yield instruments. \n \nFor details on risk mitigation measures, please refer SID. \n \n9. Plans/ Options \nPlans: Regular & Direct  \n \nRegular and Direct Plans offer the following options: \n(a) Growth Option \n(b) Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Option   \nUnder this Option, it is proposed to declare income / capital Distribution (IDCW) subject to \navailability of distributable surplus, as computed in accordance with SEBI (MF) Regulations.  \nInvestors should note that distributions can be made o ut of Equalization Reserves (representing \naccumulated realized gains), which is part of sale price paid by them.  \n➢ This Option offers following facilities: \n• Payout of IDCW (“Payout”) and  \n• Re-investment of IDCW (“Re-investment”)   \nDefault Option- Growth   \nDefault Facility- Payout  \n \nFor detailed disclosure on default plans and options, kindly refer SAI.  \n \n10. Applicable NAV (after the scheme opens for subscriptions and redemptions) \nThe below cut -off timings and applicability of NAV shall be applicable in respect  of valid \napplications received at the Official Point(s) of Acceptance on a Business Day (During Continuous \nOffer Period):  \nA]  For Purchase (including switch-in) of any amount: \n● In respect of valid applications received upto 3.00 p.m. and where the funds  for the entire \namount are available for utilization before the cut -off time i.e. credited to the bank account \nof the Scheme before the cut-off time - the closing NAV of the day shall be applicable. \n● In respect of valid applications received after 3.00 p. m. and where the funds for the entire \namount are credited to the bank account of the Scheme either at any time on the same day \nor before the cut -off time of the next Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the \n \n \n \n17  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \ncut-off time of the next Business D ay - the closing NAV of the next Business Day shall be \napplicable. \n● Irrespective of the time of receipt of application, where the funds for the entire amount are \ncredited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut -off time on any subsequent \nBusiness Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut -off time on any subsequent \nBusiness Day - the closing NAV of such subsequent Business Day shall be applicable. \nB]  For Switch-ins of any amount: \nFor determining the applicable NAV, the following shall be ensured: \n● Application for switch-in is received before the applicable cut-off time. \n● Funds for the entire amount of subscription/purchase as per the switch -in request are \ncredited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-off time. \n● The funds are available for utilization before the cut-off time. \n● In case of ‘switch’ transactions from one scheme to another, the allocation shall be in line \nwith redemption payouts. \n In case of switches, the request should be received on a day which is a Business Day  for \nthe Switch -out scheme. Redemption for switch -out shall be processed at the applicable \nNAV as per cut-off timing. Switch-in will be processed at the Applicable NAV (on a Business \nDay) based on realization of funds as per the redemption pay -out cycle fo r the switch -out \nscheme. \n For investments through systematic investment routes such as Systematic Investment Plans \n(SIP), Flex SIP, Systematic Transfer Plans (STP), Flex -STP, Swing STP, Transfer of Income \nDistribution cum Capital Withdrawal (IDCW) Plan facility (TIP), etc. the unit s will be allotted as \nper the closing NAV of the day on which the funds are available for utilization by the Target \nScheme irrespective of the installment date of the SIP, STP or record date of IDCW etc.  \n While the AMC will endeavour to deposit the paymen t instruments accompanying investment \napplication submitted to it with its bank expeditiously, it shall not be liable for delay in realization \nof funds on account of factors beyond its control such as clearing / settlement cycles of the \nbanks. \n Since diffe rent payment modes have different settlement cycles including electronic \ntransactions (as per arrangements with Payment Aggregators / Banks / Exchanges etc), it may \nhappen that the investor's account is debited, but the money is not credited within cut -off time \non the same date to the Scheme's bank account, leading to a gap / delay in Unit allotment. \nInvestors are therefore urged to use the most efficient electronic payment modes to avoid \ndelays in realization of funds and consequently in Unit allotment. \n \nC]  For Redemption (including switch-out) applications \n ● In respect of valid applications received upto 3 p.m. on a Business Day by the Fund, same \nday's closing NAV shall be applicable. \n ● In respect of valid applications received after 3 p.m. on a Busines s Day by the Fund, the \nclosing NAV of the next Business Day shall be applicable. \n \nTransactions through online facilities / electronic modes: \n \n \n \n18  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \nThe time of transaction done through various online facilities / electronic modes offered by the \nAMC, for the purpose of determining the applicability of NAV, would be the time when the request \nfor purchase / sale / switch of units is received in the servers of AMC/RTA. \n \nThe AMC has the right to amend cut off timings subject to SEBI (MF) Regulations for the smooth \nand efficient functioning of the Scheme. \n \n11. Minimum Application Amount / Number of Units  \n \nPurchase (including switch -\nin) \nAdditional Purchase \n(including switch-in) \nRedemption (including \nswitch-out) \nRs.100/- and any amount \nthereafter  \nNote: Allotment of units will be \ndone after deduction of \napplicable stamp duty and \nother charges, if any. \nRs.100/- and any amount \nthereafter \nNote: Allotment of units will be \ndone after deduction of \napplicable stamp duty and \nother charges, if any. \nRs. 100 and in multiples of Re. \n1/- thereafter. \nNote: There will be no \nminimum redemption criterion  \nfor Unit based redemption. \n \n12. Despatch of Redemption Request \nWithin 3 working days of the receipt of valid redemption request at the Official Points of \nAcceptance of HDFC Mutual Fund for this Scheme or within such timelines as may be prescribed \nby SEBI / AMFI from time to time in case of exceptional circumstances or otherwise. \n13. Benchmark Index \n NIFTY 100 Total Returns Index (TRI) \n \n14. Dividend / IDCW Policy \nIt is proposed to declare IDCW subject to availability of distributable surplus, as computed in \naccordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. \n \nIDCW, if declared, will be paid (subject of deduction of tax at source, if any) to those Unitholders / \nBeneficial Owners whose names appear in the Register of Unit holders maintained by the Mutual \nFund/ statement of beneficial ownership maintained by the Depositories, as applicable, under the \nIDCW option as on the Record Date. The IDCW payment shall be transferred to the Unit holders \nwithin 7 working days of the record date of such declaration of IDCW or such other timeline as may \nbe specified by SEBI from time to time. In the event of failure to transfer IDCW within the stipulated \nperiod, the AMC shall be liable to pay interest @ 15% per annum to the Unitholders for the delay in \npayment as computed from the Record Date or from such other date or for such period as may be \nadvised by SEBI from time to time. The Trustee/ AMC reserves the right to change the record date \nfrom time t o time. However, it must be distinctly understood that the actual declaration of IDCW \nand the frequency thereof will inter alia, depend on the availability of distributable surplus as \ncomputed in accordance with SEBI (Mutual Funds) Regulations, 1996. The decision of the Trustee \nin this regard shall be final. \n \nThere is no assurance or guarantee to unit holders as to the rate of IDCW distribution nor that \nIDCW will be paid regularly. On payment of IDCW, the NAV will stand reduced by the amount of \nIDCW and IDCW tax (if applicable) paid.  \n \n \n \n \n19  \n              \nHDFC Large Cap Fund - KIM \n \n \n15.
