The Scheme will remain diversified across key sectors \nand economic variables. \n \nThe Scheme may also invest in the hybrid securities viz. units of REITs and InvITs for diversification and \nsubject to necessary stipulations by SEBI from time to time. \n \nSubject to the Regulations and the applicable guidelines, the Scheme may engage in Stock Lending activities. \n \nInvestment in debt securities will be guided by credit quality, liquidity, interest rates and their outlook. \n \nThe Scheme may also invest in the schemes of Mutual Funds in terms of the prevailing SEBI (MF) \nRegulations. \n \nAs part of the Fund Management process, the Scheme may use derivative instruments such as futures and \noptions, or any other derivative instruments that are permissible or may be permissible  in future under \napplicable regulations. However, trading in derivatives by the Scheme shall be for restricted purposes as \npermitted by the regulations.  \n \nFor detailed derivative strategies, please refer to SAI. For exposure limits to derivatives, refer section ‘Where \nwill the scheme invest’ under Section II, Part II, Clause A \n \nThough every endeavour  will be made to achieve the objective of the Scheme, the \nAMC/Sponsor/Trustee do not guarantee that the investment objective of the Scheme will be achieved. \nNo guaranteed returns are being offered under the Scheme. \n \nRisk Control \nInvestments made by the Scheme would be in accordance with the investment objectives of the scheme and \nprovisions of SEBI (MF) Regulations. Since investing requires disciplined risk management, the AMC would \nincorporate adequate safeguards for controlling risks in the portfolio cons truction process. The risk control \nprocess involves identifying risks and taking proper measures for the same. The AMC believes that this \ndiversification would help achieve the desired level of consistency in returns. The Scheme may also use \nvarious derivatives products for the purpose of trading, hedging and portfolio balancing from time to time, \nwith an attempt to protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unitholders' interest. While these measures \nare expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance that these risks would \nbe completely eliminated. \n \n \n15  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n \n \nPORTFOLIO TURNOVER  \nThe Scheme is an open -ended Scheme. The portfolio is managed from a long  term perspective with an \nendeavour to keep portfolio turnover ratio low.  However, it is expected that there would be a number of \nsubscriptions and redemptions on a daily basis. Consequently, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable \nmeasure of accuracy, the likely turnover in the portfolio. A higher portfolio turnover results in higher brokerage \nand transaction cost. \n \nD. HOW WILL THE SCHEME BENCHMARK ITS PERFORMANCE? \nNIFTY 100 Total Returns Index (TRI) \nAs required under clause 1.9 of Master Circular, the benchmark has been selected from amongst those \nnotified by AMFI as the first tier benchmark to be adopted by mutual funds and which are reflective of the \ncategory of the scheme. \nNIFTY 100 is a diversified 100 stock index representing major sectors of the economy. This index intends to \nmeasure the performance of large market capitalisation companies. The performance will be benchmarked \nto the Total Returns Variant of the Index. \n \nThe Trustee reserves the right to change the benchmark for evaluation of performance of the Scheme from \ntime to time in conformity with the investment objectives and appropriateness of the benchmark subject to \nSEBI (MF) Regulations, and other prevailing guidelines, if any. \n \nE.

OTHER DETAILS \nA. COMPUTATION OF NAV \nMethodology for Computation of NAV: \nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) per Unit of the Scheme will be computed by dividing the net assets of the Scheme \nby the number of Units outstanding under the Scheme on the valuation date. The AMC will value its \ninvestments according to the valuation norms, as specified in Schedule VIII of the SEBI (MF) Regulations, or \nsuch norms as may be specified by SEBI from time to time and as stipulated in the Valuation Policy and \nProcedures of the Fund, provided in SAI available on website. \nIn case of any conflict between the Principles of Fair Valuation and valuation guidelines specified by SEBI, \nthe Principles of Fair Valuation shall prevail.  \nNAV of Units under each Scheme/ Plan shall be calculated as shown below: \n \n \nNAV (Rs.)\n = \nper Unit \nMarket or Fair Value of the Scheme’s Investments \n+ Current Assets \n- Current Liabilities and Provisions \n_____________________________________________ \nNo. of Units outstanding under the \nScheme/Plan \n \nThe NAV of the Scheme will be calculated and disclosed at the close of every Business Day. \nSeparate NAV will be calculated and announced for each of Plans/Options. The NAVs will be calculated upto \n3 decimals. Units will be allotted upto 3 decimals. \n \nIllustration for Computation of NAV: \nNAV for the Scheme shall be calculated as shown below: \nParticulars Amount (In INR) \nAssets  \nInvestments (at Market Value) 10,000 \n \n \n21  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n(Equity/Debt/Derivatives)  \nCurrent Assets  \nInterest receivable  \nDividend Receivables \nTrades Receivables \n1,000 \n550 \n1,500 \nTotal Assets (A) 13,050 \nCurrent Liabilities  \nTrade Payables \nExpense Payable \nDividend payable \n1,500 \n25 \n25 \nTotal Liabilities (B) 1,550 \nNet Assets (C) (A – B) 11,500 \nUnits Outstanding (D) 1,000 \nNAV per unit (C/D) ₹ 11.50 \n \nMETHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATION OF SALE AND REPURCHASE PRICE \n• Ongoing Price for subscription (purchase)/ switch-in (from other schemes/ plans of the mutual fund) \nby investors. (This is the price you need to pay for purchase/ switch-in): \nThe Sale Price for a valid purchase will be the Applicable NAV. \n i.e. Sale Price = Applicable NAV \nFor a valid purchase request of Rs. 10,000 where the applicable NAV is Rs. 11.1234, the units allotted will \nbe: \n= 10,000 (i.e. purchase amount) \n   11.1234 (i.e. applicable NAV) \n \n= 899.006 units (rounded to three decimals) \nCharges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above \nillustration.  \n• Ongoing Price for redemption (sale)/ switch -outs (to other schemes/plans of the mutual fund) by \ninvestors. (This is the price you will receive for redemptions/ switch-outs): \nThe Repurchase Price for a valid repurchase will be the applicable NAV reduced by any exit load (say 1%). \ni.e. applicable NAV - (applicable NAV X applicable exit load). \nFor a valid repurchase request where the applicable NAV is Rs. 12.1234, the repurchase price will be: \n= 12.1234 - (12.1234 X 1.00%) \n= 12.1234 - 0.1212 \n= Rs. 12.0022 \n \n \n22  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nTherefore, for a repurchase of 899.006 units, the proceeds received by the investor will be - \n= 899.006 (units) * 12.0022 (Repurchase price) \n= Rs. 10,790.02 (rounded to two decimals) \nCharges and other expenses, if any, borne by the investors have not been considered in the above \nillustration.  \nWhile determining the price of the units, the mutual fund shall ensure that the repurchase price of an open \nended scheme is not lower than 97 per cent of the Net Asset Value. \n \nFor other details such as policies w ith respect to  computation of NAV, rounding off, investment in foreign  \nsecurities, procedure in case of delay in disclosure of NAV etc. refer to SAI. \nB.

RISK FACTORS \n■ Scheme Specific Risk Factors: \nSome of the specific risk factors related to the Scheme include, but are not limited to the following: \n(i) Risk factors associated with investing in equities and equity related instruments \n● Equity shares and equity related instruments are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis. \nInvestments in equity shares and equity related instruments involve a degree of risk and investors should \nnot invest in the Scheme unless they can afford to take the risks. \n● Securities, which are not quoted on the stock exchanges, are inherently illiquid in nature and carry a larger \namount of liquidity risk, in comparison to securities that are listed on the exchanges. Investment in such \nsecurities may lead to increase in the scheme portfolio risk.  \n● While securities that are listed on the stock exchange carry lower liquidity risk, the ability to sell these \ninvestments is limited by the overall trading volume on the stock exchanges and may lead to the Scheme \nincurring losses till the security is finally sold. \n● Scheme's performance may differ from the benchmark index to the extent of the investments held in the \ndebt segment, as per the investment pattern indicated under normal circumstances. \n \n(ii) Risk factors associated with investing in Fixed Income Securities \n• The Net Asset Value (NAV) of the Scheme, to the extent invested in Debt and Money Market \ninstruments, will be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The NAV of the Scheme \nis expected to increase from a fall in interest rates while it would be adversely affected by an increase \nin the level of interest rates. \n• Money market instruments, while fairly liquid, lack a well developed  secondary market, which may \nrestrict the selling ability of the Scheme and may lead to the Scheme incurring losses till the security \nis finally sold. \n• Investments in money market instruments involve credit risk commensurate with short term rating of \nthe issuers. \n• Investment in Debt instruments are subject to varying degree of credit risk or default (i.e. the risk of \nan issuer's inability to meet interest or principal payments on its obligations) or any other issues, which \nmay have their credit ratings downgr aded. Changes in financial conditions of an issuer, changes in \neconomic and political conditions in general, or changes in economic or and political conditions \nspecific to an issuer, all of which are factors that may have an adverse impact on an issuer's c redit \nquality and security values. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. The Investment Manager will \nendeavour to manage credit risk through in-house credit analysis. \n• Prepayment Risk: Certain fixed income securities give an issuer the right to call back its securities \nbefore their maturity date, in periods of declining interest rates. The possibility of such prepayment \nmay force the Scheme to reinvest the proceeds of such investments in securities offering lower yields, \nresulting in lower interest income for the Scheme. \n• Reinvestment Risk: This risk refers to the interest rate levels at which cash flows received from the \nsecurities in the Scheme are reinvested. The additional income from reinvestment is the \"interest on \n \n \n27  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \ninterest\" component. The risk is  that the rate at which interim cash flows can be reinvested may be \nlower than that originally assumed. \n• Settlement risk: Different segments of Indian financial markets have different settlement periods and \nsuch periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances. Delays or other problems \nin settlement of transactions could result in temporary periods when the assets of the Scheme are \nuninvested and no return is earned thereon. The inability of the Scheme to make intended securities \npurchases, due to settlement problems, could cause the Scheme to miss certain investment \nopportunities. Similarly, the inability to sell securities held in the Scheme's portfolio, due to the \nabsence of a well developed and liquid secondary market for debt securities,  may result at times in \npotential losses to the Scheme in the event of a subsequent decline in the value of securities held in \nthe Scheme's portfolio. \n• Government securities where a fixed return is offered run price -risk like any other fixed income \nsecurity. Generally, when interest rates rise, prices of fixed income securities fall and when interest \nrates drop, the prices increase. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a function of the existing \ncoupon, days to maturity and the increase or decrease in the level of interest rates. The new level of \ninterest rate is determined by the rates at which government raises new money and/or the price levels \nat which the market is already dealing in existing securities. The price-risk is not unique to Government \nSecurities. It exists for all fixed income securities. However, Government Securities are unique in the \nsense that their credit risk generally remains zero. Therefore, their prices are influenced only by \nmovement in interest rates in the financial system. \n• Different types of fixed income securities in which the Scheme would invest as given in the Scheme \nInformation Document carry different levels and types of risk. Accordingly, the Scheme risk may \nincrease or decrease depending upon its investment pattern. e.g. corporate bonds carry a higher level \nof risk than Government securities. Further even among corporate bonds, AAA rated bonds are \ncomparatively less risky than AA rated bonds.  \n• The AMC may, considering the overall level of risk of the portfolio, invest i n lower rated / unrated \nsecurities offering higher yields as well as zero coupon securities that offer attractive yields. This may \nincrease the absolute level of risk of the portfolio. \n• As zero coupon securities do not provide periodic interest payments to the holder of the security, these \nsecurities are more sensitive to changes in interest rates and are subject to issuer default risk. \nTherefore, the interest rate risk of zero coupon securities is higher. The AMC may choose to invest in \nzero coupon securiti es that offer attractive yields. This may increase the risk of the portfolio. Zero \ncoupon or deep discount bonds are debt obligations that do not entitle the holder to any periodic \npayment of interest prior to maturity or a specified date when the securiti es begin paying current \ninterest and therefore, are generally issued and traded at a discount to their face values. The discount \ndepends on the time remaining until maturity or the date when securities begin paying current interest. \nIt also varies dependin g on the prevailing interest rates, liquidity of the security and the perceived \ncredit risk of the Issuer. The market prices of zero coupon securities are generally more volatile than \nthe market prices of securities that pay interest periodically. \n \n(iii) Risks associated with investment in unlisted securities:  \nExcept for any security of an associate or group company, the scheme can invest in securities which \nare not listed on a stock exchange (“unlisted Securities”) which in general are subject to greater price \nfluctuations, less liquidity and greater risk than those which are traded in the open market. Unlisted \ndebt securities may lack a liquid secondary market and there can be no assurance that the Scheme \nwill realise their investments in unlisted securities at a fair value.  \n• Investment in unrated instruments may involve a risk of default or decline in market value higher than \nrated instruments due to adverse economic and issuer -specific developments. Such investments \ndisplay increased price sensitivity t o changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic \nenvironment. The market values for unrated investments tends to be more volatile and such securities \ntend to be less liquid than rated debt securities. \n \n \n \n28  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n \n \n(iv) Risks associated with Investing in Structured Obligation (SO) & Credit Enhancement (CE) rated \nsecurities \n The risks factors stated below for the Structured Obligations & Credit Enhancement are in addition to the \nrisk factors associated with debt instruments. \n• Credit rating agencies assign CE rating to an instrument based on any identifiable credit enhancement \nfor the debt instrument issued by an issuer. The credit enhancement could be in various forms and \ncould include guarantee, shortfall undertaking, letter o f comfort, etc. from another entity. This entity \ncould be either related or non -related to the issuer like a bank, financial institution, etc. Credit \nenhancement could include additional security in form of pledge of shares listed on stock exchanges, \netc. SO transactions are asset backed/ mortgage backed securities, securitized paper backed by \nhypothecation of car loan receivables, securities backed by trade receivables, credit card receivables \netc. Hence, for CE rated instruments evaluation of the credit e nhancement provider, as well as the \nissuer is undertaken to determine the issuer rating. In case of SO rated issuer, the underlying loan \npools or securitization, etc. is assessed to arrive at rating for the issuer. \n•  Liquidity Risk:  SO rated securities are often complex structures, with a variety of credit \nenhancements. Debt securities lack a well-developed secondary market in India, and due to the credit \nenhanced nature of CE securities as well as structured nature of SO securities, the liquidity in the \nmarket for these instruments is adversely affected compared to similar rated debt instruments. Hence, \nlower liquidity of such instruments, could lead to inability of the scheme to sell such debt instruments \nand generate liquidity for the scheme or higher impact cost when such instruments are sold. \n•  Credit Risk: The credit risk of debt instruments which are CE rated is based on the combined strength \nof the issuer as well as the structure. Hence, any weakness in either the issuer or the structure could \nhave an adverse credit impact on the debt instrument. The weakness in structure could arise due to \ninability of the investors to enforce the structure due to issues such as legal risk, inability to sell the \nunderlying collateral or enforce guarantee, etc. In case o f SO transactions, comingling risk and risk \nof servicer increases the overall risk for the securitized debt or assets backed transactions. Therefore, \napart from issuer level credit risk such debt instruments are also susceptible to structure related credit \nrisk. \n \n(v) Risk factors associated with investment in Tri-Party Repo \n The mutual fund is a member of securities segment and Triparty Repo trade settlement of the Clearing \nCorporation of India (CCIL). All transactions of the mutual fund in government securities and in Tri-party \nRepo trades are settled centrally through the infrastructure and settlement systems provided by CCIL; \nThus, reducing the settlement and counterparty risks considerably for transactions in the said segments. \nThe members are required to contribute an amount as communicated by CCIL from time to time to the \ndefault fund maintained by CCIL as a part of the default waterfall (a loss mitigating measure of CCIL in \ncase of default by any member in settling transactions routed through CCIL). \n As per the waterfall mechanism, after the defaulter's margins and the defaulter's contribution to the default \nfund have been appropriated, CCIL's contribution is used to meet the losses. Post utilization of CCIL's \ncontribution if there is a residual lo ss, it is appropriated from the default fund contributions of the non -\ndefaulting members. Thus, the scheme is subject to risk of the initial margin and default fund contribution \nbeing invoked in the event of failure of any settlement obligations. In additi on, the fund contribution is \nallowed to be used to meet the residual loss in case of default by the other clearing member (the defaulting \nmember). \n \n \n29  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n CCIL shall maintain two separate Default Funds in respect of its Securities Segment, one with a view to \nmeet losses arising out of any default by its members from outright and repo trades and the other for \nmeeting losses arising out of any default by its members from Triparty Repo trades. The mutual fund is \nexposed to the extent of its contribution to the defaul t fund of CCIL, in the event that the contribution of \nthe mutual fund is called upon to absorb settlement/default losses of another member by CCIL, as a result \nthe scheme may lose an amount equivalent to its contribution to the default fund. \n \n(vi) Risk factors associated with investing in Foreign Securities \n●  Currency Risk: \n Moving from Indian Rupee (INR) to any other currency entails currency risk. To the extent that the assets \nof the Scheme will be invested in securities denominated in foreign currencies, the Indian Rupee \nequivalent of the net assets, distributions and income may be adversely affected by changes in the value \nof certain foreign currencies relative to the Indian Rupee. \n● Interest Rate Risk: \n The pace and movement of interest rate cycles of various countries, though loosely co-related, can differ \nsignificantly. Hence by investing in securities of countries other than India, the Scheme stand exposed to \ntheir interest rate cycles. \n● Credit Risk: \n Investment in Foreign Debt Securities are subject to the risk of an issuer's inability to meet interest and \nprincipal payments on its obligations and market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer. This is \nsubstantially reduced since the SEBI (MF) Regulations stipulate investments only in debt instruments with \nrating not below investment grade by accredited/registered credit rating agency. \n● Taxation Risk: \n In addition to the disclosure related to taxation mentioned in Statement of Additional Information (SAI) \nunder section “ Special Consideration”, Investment in Foreign Securities poses additional challenges \nbased on the tax laws of each respective country or jurisdiction. The scheme may be subject to a higher \nlevel of taxes than originally anticipated and or dual taxation. \n The Scheme may be subject to withholding or other taxes on income and/or gains arising from its \ninvestment portfolio. Further, such investments are exposed to risks associated with the changing / \nevolving tax / regulatory regimes of all the countries where the Scheme  invests. All these may entail a \nhigher outgo to the Scheme by way of taxes, transaction costs, fees etc. thus adversely impacting its \nNAV; resulting in lower returns to an Investor. \n● Legal and Regulatory Risk: \n Legal and regulatory changes could occur during the term of the Scheme which may adversely affect it. \nIf any of the laws and regulations currently in effect should change or any new laws or regulations should \nbe enacted, the legal requirements to which the Scheme and the investors may be subject co uld differ \nmaterially from current requirements and may materially and adversely affect the Scheme and the \ninvestors. Legislation/ Regulatory guidelines could also be imposed retrospectively. \n● Country Risk: \n The Country risk arises from the inability of a country, to meet its financial obligations. It is the risk \nencompassing economic, social and political conditions in a foreign country, which might adversely affect \nforeign investors' financial interests. In addition, country risks would include events such as introduction \nof extraordinary exchange controls, economic deterioration, bi-lateral conflict leading to immobilisation of \nthe overseas financial assets and the prevalent tax laws of the respective jurisd iction for execution of \ntrades or otherwise.  \n \n \n30  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n● To manage risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate exposure, the Mutual Fund may use \nderivatives for efficient portfolio management including hedging and in accordance with conditions as may \nbe stipulated by SEBI/ RBI from time to time. \n \n• Exhaustion of Limit for investments in Overseas Securities:  \nIn case the permissible limits for investments in overseas Securities by the Scheme  provided by regulatory \nbodies is reached, then the scheme may not be able to make any further investments in permissible Overseas \nSecurities. This could lead to loss of investment opportunity. \n \n(vii) Risk factors associated with investing in Derivatives  \n● The AMC, on behalf of the Scheme may use various derivative products, from time to time, in an attempt \nto protect the value of the portfolio and enhance Unit holders' interest. Derivative products are specialized \ninstruments that require investment techniques and risk analysis different from those associated with \nstocks and bonds. The use of a derivative requires an understanding not only of the underlying instrument \nbut of the derivative itself. Other risks include, the risk of mispricing or improper valuation and the inability \nof derivatives to correlate perfectly with underlying assets, rates and indices. \n● Derivative products are leveraged instruments and can provide disproportionate gains as well as \ndisproportionate losses to the investor. Execution of such strategies depends upon the ability of the fund \nmanager to identify such opportunities. Identification and execution of the strategies to be pursued by the \nfund manager involve uncertainty and decision of fund manager may not always be profitable. No \nassurance can be given that the fund manager will be able to identify or execute such strategies. \n● The risks associated with the use of derivatives are different from or possibly greater than, the risks \nassociated with investing directly in securities and other traditional investments. \n● Credit Risk: \n The credit risk in derivative transaction is the risk that the counter party will default on its obligations and \nis generally low, as there is no exchange of principal amounts in a derivative transaction. \n● Market Risk: \n Market movements may adversely affect the pricing and settlement of derivatives. \n● Illiquidity risk: \n This is the risk that a derivative cannot be sold or purchased quickly enough at a fair price, due to lack of \nliquidity in the market. \n \n Additional Risk viz. Basis Risk associated with imperfect hedging using Interest Rate  Futures \n(IRF): The imperfect correlation between the prices of securities in the portfolio and the IRF contract used \nto hedge part of the portfolio leads to basis risk. Thus, the loss on the portfolio may not exactly match the \ngain from the hedge position entered using the IRF. \n \n(viii) Risk factors associated with investing in Non- Convertible Preference Shares \n● Credit Risk - Credit risk is the risk that an issuer will be unable to meet its obligation of payment of \nDividend and/ or redemption of principal amount on the due date. Further, for non-cumulative preference \nshares, issuer also has an option to not pay Dividends on preference shares in case of inadequate profits \nin any year. \n● Liquidity Risk - The preference shares generally have limited secondary market liquidity and thus we \nmay be forced to hold the instrument till maturity. \n \n \n31  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n● Unsecured in nature - Preference shares are unsecured in nature and rank lower than secured and \nunsecured debt in hierarchy of payments in case of liquidation. Thus there is significant risk of capital \nerosion in case the company goes into liquidation. \n \n(ix) Risk factors associated with Securities Lending  \n As with other modes of extensions of credit, there are risks inherent to securities lending, including the \nrisk of failure of the other party, in this case the approved intermediary, to comply with the terms of the \nagreement entered into between the lender of securities i.e. the Scheme and the approved intermediary. \nSuch failure can result in the possible loss of rights to the collateral put up by the borrower of the securities, \nthe inability of the approved intermediary to return the securities deposited by the lender and the possible \nloss of any corporate benefits accruing to the lender from the securities deposited with the approved \nintermediary. The scheme may not be able to sell lent out securities, which can lead to temporary illiquidity \n& loss of opportunity. \n \n(x)  Risk factors associated with investing in Securitised Debt \n The Risks involved in Securitised Papers described below are the principal ones and does not represent \nthat the statement of risks set out hereunder is exhaustive. \n● Limited Liquidity & Price Risk \n There is no assurance that a deep secondary market will develop for the Certificates. This could limit the \nability of the investor to resell them. \n● Limited Recourse, Delinquency and Credit Risk \n The Credit Enhancement stipulated re presents a limited loss cover to the Investors. These Certificates \nrepresent an undivided beneficial interest in the underlying receivables and do not represent an obligation \nof either the Issuer or the Seller or the originator, or the parent or any affili ate of the Seller, Issuer and \nOriginator. No financial recourse is available to the Certificate Holders against the Investors' \nRepresentative. Delinquencies and credit losses may cause depletion of the amount available under the \nCredit Enhancement and thereby the Investor Payouts to the Certificate Holders may get affected if the \namount available in the Credit Enhancement facility is not enough to cover the shortfall. On persistent \ndefault of an Obligor to repay his obligation, the Servicer may repossess an d sell the Asset. However, \nmany factors may affect, delay or prevent the repossession of such Asset or the length of time required \nto realise the sale proceeds on such sales. In addition, the price at which such Asset may be sold may \nbe lower than the amount due from that Obligor. \n● Risks due to possible prepayments and Charge Offs \n In the event of prepayments, investors may be exposed to changes in tenor and yield. Also, any Charge \nOffs would result in the reduction in the tenor of the Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). \n● Bankruptcy of Bank with Liquidity facility \n If the Bank with Liquidity facility, becomes subject to bankruptcy proceedings then an investor could \nexperience losses or delays in the payments. \n● Risk of Co-mingling \n With respect to the Certificates, the Servicer will deposit all payments received from the Obligors into the \nCollection Account. However, there could be a time gap between collection by a Servicer and depositing \nthe same into the Collection account especially considering that  some of the collections may be in the \nform of cash. In this interim period, collections from the Loan Agreements may not be segregated from \nother funds of originator. If originator in its capacity as Servicer fails to remit such funds due to Investors, \nthe Investors may be exposed to a potential loss. \n \n \n \n32  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n(xi) Risk factors associated with investments in Perpetual Debt Instrument (PDI) \n Perpetual Debt instruments are issued by Banks, NBFCs and corporates to improve their capital profile. \nSome of the PDIs issued by Banks which are governed by the RBI guidelines for Basel III Capital \nRegulations are referred to as Additional Tier I (AT1 bonds). While there are no regulatory guidelines for \nissuance of PDIs by corporate bodies, NBFCs issue these bonds as per g uidelines issued by RBI. The \ninstruments are treated as perpetual in nature as there is no fixed maturity date.  The key risks associated \nwith these instruments are highlighted below: \n Key Risk Factors: \n - Risk on coupon servicing \n  Banks \n  As per the term s of the instruments, Banks may have discretion at all times to cancel distributions/ \npayment of coupons. In the event of non-availability of adequate distributable reserves and surpluses \nor inadequacy in terms of capital requirements, RBI may not allow ba nks to make  payment of \ncoupons. \n  NBFCs \n  While NBFCs may have discretion at all times to cancel payment of coupon, coupon can also be \ndeferred (instead of being cancelled), in case paying the coupon leads to breach of capital ratios. \n  Corporates \n  Corporates usually have discretion to defer the payment of coupon. However, the coupon is usually \ncumulative and any deferred coupon shall accrue interest at the original coupon rate of the PDI. \n - Risk of write-down or conversion into equity \n  Banks \n  As per the regulatory requirements, Banks have to maintain a minimum Common Equity Tier-1 (CET-\n1) ratio of Risk Weighted Assets (RWAs), failing which the AT-1 bonds can get written down. Further, \nAT-1 Bonds are liable to be written down or converted to common equity, at the discretion of RBI, in \nthe event of Point of Non Viability Trigger (PONV). PONV is a point, determined by RBI, when a bank \nis deemed to have become non-viable unless there is a write off/ conversion to equity of AT-1 Bonds \nor a public sector capital injection happens. The write off/conversion has to occur prior to public sector \ninjection of capital. This risk is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. \n - Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer \n  Banks \n  The issuing banks have an option to call back the instrument after minimum specified period from the \ndate of issuance, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. However, if the bank does not exercise the \ncall on first call date, the Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the first call \nexercise date.   \n \nNBFCs \nThe NBFC issuer has an option to call back the instrument after minimum specific period as per the \nregulatory requirement from date of issuance and thereafter, subject to meeting the RBI guidelines. \nHowever, if the NBFC does not exercise the call option the Scheme may have to hold the instruments \nfor a period beyond the first call exercise date. \n \n  Corporates \n \n \n33  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n  There is no minimum period for call date. However, if the corporate does not exercise the call option, \nthe Scheme may have to hold the instruments for a period beyond the call exercise date. \n \n(xii) Risk factors associated with Short Selling \n Short-selling is the sale of shares which are not owned by the seller at the time of trade. Instead, he \nborrows it from someone who already owns it. Later, the short seller buys back the stock he shorted and \nreturns the stock to close out the loan. If the price of the stock corrects, Short seller can buy the stock \nback for less than he received for selling it and earn profit (the difference between higher short sale price \nand the lower purchase price).If the price of stock appreciates, short selling results in loss. Thus, Short \npositions carry the risk of losing money and these losses may grow theoretically unlimited if the price \nincreases without limit and shall result into major losses in the portfolio. \n \n(xiii) Risk factors associated with REITs and InvITs: \n● Price Risk: \n Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs are volatile and prone to price fluctuations on a daily basis \nowing to market movements. The extent of fall or rise in the prices is a fluctuation in general market \nconditions, factors and forces affecting capital  market, Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors, level of \ninterest rates, trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures. \n● Interest Rate Risk: \n Securities/Instruments of REITs and InvITs run interest rate risk. Generally, when interest rates rise, \nprices of units fall and when interest rates drop, such prices increase. \n● Credit Risk: \n Credit risk means that the issuer of a REIT/InvIT security/ instrument may default on interest payment or \neven on paying back the principal amount on maturity. S ecurities/ Instruments of REITs and InvITs are \nlikely to have volatile cash flows as the repayment dates would not necessarily be pre scheduled. \n● Liquidity Risk: \n This refers to the ease with which securities/instruments of REITs/InvITs can be sold. There  is no \nassurance that an active secondary market will develop or be maintained. Hence there would be time \nwhen trading in the units could be infrequent. The subsequent valuation of illiquid units may reflect a \ndiscount from the market price of comparable s ecurities/instruments for which a liquid market exists. As \nthese products are new to the market they are likely to be exposed to liquidity risk. \n● Reinvestment Risk: \n Investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs may carry reinvestment risk as there could be \nrepatriation of funds by the Trusts in form of buyback of units or Dividend pay -outs, etc. Consequently, \nthe proceeds may get invested in assets providing lower returns. \n● Legal and Regulatory Risk \n The regulatory framework governing investments in securities/instruments of REITs and InvITs comprises \na relatively new set of regulations and is therefore untested, interpretation and enforcement by regulators \nand courts involves uncertainties. Presently, it is difficult to forecast as to how any new laws, regulations \nor standards or future amendments will affect the issuers of REITs/InvITs and the sector as a whole. \nFurthermore, no assurance can be given that the regulatory system will not change in a way  that will \nimpair the ability of the Issuers to comply with the regulations, conduct the business, compete effectively \nor make distributions. \n \n \n \n \n34  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nxiv) Risk factors associated with Repo in permitted Corporate Debt Securities \n \n In repo transactions, also known as a repo or sale repurchase agreement, securities are sold with the seller \nagreeing to buy them back at later date. The repurchase price should be greater than the original sale price, \nthe difference effectively representing interest. A repo in corporate debt securities is economically similar to \na secured loan, with the buyer receiving corporate debt securities as collateral to protect against default. \nSome of the risks associated with repo in corporate debt are given below: \n Counterparty Risk: Counterparty risk refers to the inability of the seller to meet the obligation to buy back \nsecurities at the contracted price on the contracted date. In case of over the counter (OTC) repo trades, the \ninvestment manager will endeavour to manage counterparty risk by dealing only with counterparties having \nstrong credit profiles. Also, the counter-party risk is to an extent mitigated by taking collateral equivalent in \nvalue to the transaction after knocking off a minimum haircut on the  intrinsic value of the collateral. In the \nevent of default by the repo counterparty, the scheme shall have recourse to the corporate debt securities. \nIn case the repo transaction is executed on exchange platform approved by RBI/SEBI, the exchange may \nalso provide settlement guarantee. \n \n Collateral Risk: Collateral risk arises when the market value of the securities is inadequate to meet the \nrepo obligations. This risk can be partly mitigated by restricting participation in repo transactions only in \ncorporate debt securities which are approved by credit risk team. Additionally, to address the risk related to \nreduction in market value of corporate debt security held as collateral due to credit rating downgrade, the \nrepo contract can incorporate either an early termination of the repo agreement or call for fresh margin to \nmeet the minimum haircut requirement or call for replacement of security with eligible security. Moreover, \nthe investment manager may apply a higher haircut on the underlying security than required as per \nRBI/SEBI regulation to adjust for the illiquidity and interest rate risk on the underlying instrument. To \nmitigate the risk of price reduction due to interest rate changes, the adequacy of the collateral can be \nmonitored on a daily basis by considering the daily market value & applying the prescribed haircut. The \nfund manager or the exchange can then arrange for additional collateral from the counterparty, within a \nprespecified period. If the counterparty is not able to top-up either in form of cash / collateral, it would \ntantamount to early termination of the repo agreement, and the outstanding amount can be recovered by \nsale of collateral. \n(xv) Risk factors associated for investments in Mutual Fund Schemes \n \n1. Movements in the Net Asset Value (NAV) of these Schemes may impact the performance. Any \nchange in the investment policies or fundamental attributes of these Schemes will affect the \nperformance of the Scheme to the extent of investment in such schemes.  \n \n2. Redemptions by in these Schemes would be subject to applicable exit loads. \n \n(xvi) General Risk factors \n• Trading volumes, settlement periods and transfer procedures may restrict the liquidity of the investments \nmade by the Scheme. Different segments of the Indian financial markets have different settlement periods \nand such periods may be extended significantly by unforeseen circumstances leading to delays in receipt \nof proceeds from sale of securities. The NAV of the Units of the Scheme can go up or down beca use of \nvarious factors that affect the capital markets in general. \n• As the liquidity of the investments made by the Scheme could, at times, be restricted by trading volumes \nand settlement periods, the time taken by the Mutual Fund for redemption of Units may be significant in \nthe event of an inordinately large number of redemption requests or restructuring of the Scheme. In view \nof the above, the Trustee has the right, in its sole discretion, to limit redemptions (including suspending \n \n \n35  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nredemptions) under certain circumstances, as described under section Right to Restrict Redemption \nand / or Suspend Redemption of the units. \n• At times, due to the forces and factors affecting the capital market, the Scheme may not be able to invest \nin securities falling within its investment objective resulting in holding the monies collected by it in cash \nor cash equivalent or invest the same in other permissible securities / investments amounting to \nsubstantial reduction in the earning capability of the Scheme. The Scheme may retain certain investments \nin cash or cash equivalents for its day-to-day liquidity requirements. \n• Investment strategy to be adopted by the Scheme may carry the risk of significant variance between the \nportfolio allocation of the Scheme and the Benchmark particularly over a short to medium term period. \n• Performance of the Scheme may be affected by political, social, and economic developments, which may \ninclude changes in government policies, diplomatic conditions, and taxation policies.    \n• The Scheme at times may receive large number of redemption requests, leading to an asset -liability \nmismatch and therefore, requiring the investment manager to make a distress sale of the securities \nleading to realignment of the portfolio and consequently resulting in investment in lower yield instruments. \n \nC. RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES \n           Risk Mitigation measures for investments in equity / equity related and debt instruments \n \n• The Scheme will maintain a minimum exposure of 80% to Large -Cap stocks. These stocks are \ncharacterised by a high level of trading volumes imparting relatively high liquidity to the portfolio. \n \n• Within its investment universe, the Scheme aims to maintain a well -diversified equity portfolio \ncomprising stocks across various sectors of the economy. This shall a id in managing concentration \nrisk and sector specific risks. \n \n• Any investments in debt securities would be undertaken after assessing the associated credit risk, \ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk. \n \nCredit Evaluation Policy \nThe credit evaluation policy o f the AMC entails evaluation of credit fundamentals of each investment \nopportunity. Some of the factors that are evaluated inter -alia may include outlook on the sector, parentage, \nquality of management, and overall financial strength of the credit. The AMC  utilises ratings of recognized \nrating agencies as an input in the credit evaluation process. Investments in bonds and debenture are usually \nin instruments that have been assigned high investment grade ratings by a recognized rating agency. \nIn line with clause 12.12 of Master Circular, the AMC may constitute committee(s) to approve proposals for \ninvestments in unrated instruments. The AMC Board and the Trustee shall approve the detailed parameters \nfor such investments. The details of such investments would be communicated by the AMC to the Trustee in \ntheir periodical reports. It would also be clearly mentioned in the reports, how the parameters have been \ncomplied with. However, in case any security does not fall under the parameters, the prior approval of Board \nof AMC and Trustee shall be sought. \n Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to sell / liquidate a security at short notice at \nprevailing market prices or without incurring impact cost. While government bonds, money market \ninstruments and shorter maturity instruments are generally easier to sell, corporate bonds and other \ninstruments typically face higher liquidity risk. Further, higher rated securities normally are more liquid \ncompared to lower rated securities. As a result, different portfolios will face different levels of liquidity risk \nbased on the underlying portfolio composition. Some of the strategies to reduce liquidity risk are creating \nportfolios that are diversified across maturities, ratings, types of securities, etc. i n line with the fund \nobjectives, regulations and investment strategy. \n \n \n36  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n Credit Risk: Lower rated securities have a higher credit risk compared to higher rated securities. Hence, \ncredit risk faced by different schemes will be different based on the underlyi ng portfolio / investment \nstrategy. To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in-depth credit evaluation of each issuer will be \nundertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative factors \n(parentage, tra ck record etc.). Each of the scheme/portfolio will endeavour to maintain adequate \ndiversification across issuers / sectors in line with scheme objectives, regulations and investment \nstrategy.  Unrated investments, if any, would require specific approval fr om a committee constituted for \nthe purpose. \n Debt Derivatives Risk: The AMC has provision for using derivative instruments for portfolio balancing \nand hedging purposes. Interest Rate Swaps will be done with approved counter parties under pre \napproved ISDA agreements. Mark to Market of swaps, netting off of cash flow and default provision \nclauses will be provided as per standard practice on a reciprocal basis. Interest Rate Swaps and other \nderivative instruments will be used as per local (RBI and SEBI) regulatory guidelines. \n Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk of change in the NAVs due to change in overall market \nyields. The change in value of a security, for a given change in yield, is higher for a security with higher \nduration and vice versa. Hence portfolios with higher duratio n will have higher volatility. The AMC shall \nstrive to actively manage the duration of the respective funds based on the prevailing market conditions \n/ outlook of interest rates, keeping in mind the scheme objectives, investment strategy and applicable \nregulations.  \n Concentration Risk: The AMC will attempt to mitigate this risk by maintaining adequate diversification \nacross issuers/ sectors / instrument type in line with the scheme objectives, investment strategy and \napplicable regulations. This will also be managed by keeping prudent investment limits on any particular \nindustry or issuer or issuer group based on the size, credit profile, etc. to reduce issuer or industry specific \nrisk. \n \nRisk Mitigation measures for investments in Non-Convertible Preference Shares: \n Credit Risk - To reduce the credit risk, a comprehensive and in -depth credit evaluation of each issuer \nwill be undertaken, using both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios etc.) and qualitative \nfactors (parentage, track record etc.). \n Liquidity Risk - The Fund endeavours to invest in preference shares of those companies which have \nrelatively better market acceptability amongst market participants that increases the probability of \nsecondary sale in case an exit from the investment is required. \n Unsecured in nature - The Fund endeavours to mitigate this risk by exercising due diligence while \nassessing the business, financial and management risks of the company before investing. \n \nRisk Mitigation factors relating to investment in Perpetual Debt Instruments (PDI): \n \n• Risk on coupon servicing and Risk of write-down or conversion into equity \n \nBanks: The risks on coupon servicing or principal write down/ conversion to equity are mitigated, to a certain \nextent, if the investee bank has strong financial position and meets the required regulatory guidelines. Hence, \nan in -depth credit evaluation of each ba nk is undertaken, keeping in mind both quantitative (leverage, \nprofitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, track record etc.). \nGiven the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track record of profitability, distributable \nsurplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to infuse capital, in case it is needed. \nInvestment is done only in the AT -1 bonds of banks with strong credit worthiness, in our assessment. This, \nin turn, reduces the risk of its capital position falling below regulatory requirements and / or reaching PONV.  \n \n \n \n37  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nRisk of write-down or conversion into equity is not applicable in case of NBFCs and Corporates. \n \n•  Risk on coupon servicing \n \nNBFCs \nThese risks are mitigated, to certain extent, if the investee NBFC has strong financial position and meets the \nrequired regulatory guidelines. Hence, an in-depth credit evaluation of each NBFC is undertaken, keeping in \nmind both quantitative (leverage, profitability, solvency ratios, capital adequacy, etc.) and qualitative factors \n(parentage, track record etc.). Given the regulatory guidelines, special focus is on capital cushion, track \nrecord of profitability, distributable surplus and/or strong parentage which has the capacity and willingness to \ninfuse capital, in case it is needed. \n \nCorporates \nTo mitigate this risk, an in -depth credit evaluation of each corporate is undertaken, keeping in mind both \nquantitative (leverage, profitability, industry position, market share e tc.) and qualitative factors (parentage, \ntrack record etc.). Additionally, given that the coupon is usually cumulative in nature and the corporate is \nrestricted from paying any dividends till all previous dues are paid to the perpetual bond investor, the company \nhas adequate incentive to not defer coupon on PDIs. \n \n•  Risk of instrument not being called by the Issuer \n \nBanks \nWhile the issuer bank does have an option to not exercise the first call, experience suggests that all Indian \nbanks till now have exercised the call option during the call period. We believe that banks are cognizant of \nthe investor sensitivities with regards to risk of not exercising the call option at the first call date. Further, as \nwe invest in issuers with sound credit worthiness, we expect them to understand the importance of exercising \nthe call as the part of their long term capital raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of call option exercise \ncan lead to increase in cost of AT1 bonds for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond \ntenors) and impact the bank's profitability adversely. Given the importance of AT1 instruments for prudently \nmanaging the capital levels and improving the returns for the equity holders, we are of the opinion that banks \nwould choose to service the interest on AT1 bonds and exercise the first call option on AT1 bonds, as they \nhave done in the past. F inally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual instrument on first call date \n(say due to market disruption), the annual call on these instruments would enable the bank to call the bond \non any of the subsequent annual call options dates. \n \nNBFCs and Corporates \nWhile the issuer is not obligated to exercise the call option on first call date, the coupon step -up usually \nprovides financial incentive to the Issuer to exercise the call option. Further, as we invest in issuer with sound \ncredit worthiness, we expect them to be cognizant of the investor sensitivities with regards to exercising the \ncall as the part of their long term resource raising strategy. Any instance of skipping of first call option exercise \ncan lead to increase in cost of PDI for future issuance (as investor would start factoring in longer bond tenors) \nand impact the issuer's profitability adversely. Finally, in case the issuer is unable to call the perpetual \ninstrument on first call date (say due to market disruption), the coupon step up also compensates the investor \nfor extended holding period. \n \nWhile these measures are expected to mitigate the above risks to a large extent, there can be no assurance \nthat these risks would be completely eliminated. \n \n \nII.

As per clause 12.19.1.1 to 12.19.1.3 of Master Circular: \n1.1.  Mutual Funds can make overseas investments subject  to a maximum of US $ 1 b illion per \nMutual Fund, within the overall industry limit of US $ 7 billion. \n1.2.

The appointment of such intermediaries shall be in \naccordance with the applicable requirements of SEBI and within the permissible ceilings of expenses as \nstated under Regulation 52 of SEBI (MF) Regulations. \n \n• Investment in Securitised Debt \n A securitisation transaction involves sale of receivables by the originator (a bank,  non-banking finance \ncompany, housing finance company, or a manufacturing/service company) to a Special Purpose Vehicle \n(SPV), typically set up in the form of a trust. Investors are issued rated Pass Through Certificates (PTCs), \nthe proceeds of which are paid as consideration to the originator. In this manner, the originator, by selling \n \n \n41  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nhis loan receivables to an SPV, receives consideration from investors much before the maturity of the \nunderlying loans. Investors are paid from the collections of the underlying loans from borrowers. Typically, \nthe transaction is provided with a limited amount of credit enhancement (as stipulated by the rating agency \nfor a target rating), which provides protection to investors against defaults by the underlying borrowers. \n Generally available asset classes for securitisation in India are: \n ● Commercial vehicles \n ● Auto and two wheeler pools \n ● Mortgage pools (residential housing loans) \n ● Personal loan, credit card and other retail loans \n ● Corporate loans/receivables \nInvestment / Risk Mitigation Strategy \n1. Risk profile of securitised debt vis-à-vis risk appetite of the Scheme \n The risk profile of securitised debt is generally at par with the risk profile of other debt securities at the \nsame level of credit rating.  Securitised debt offers additional income (spread) over a debt security of \nsimilar rating and maturity, which enables the scheme to optimize its income without taking any additional \ncredit risk. Securitised debt is generally less liquid, however, investmen t in securitised debt is made to \nmaintain a diversified portfolio of debt securities that optimizes return without increasing the overall risk \nprofile of the Scheme. \n \n2. Policy relating to originators based on nature of originator, track record, NPAs, loss es in earlier \nsecuritised debt, etc \n The originator is an entity (like banks, non-banking finance companies, corporates etc), which has initially \nprovided the loan & is also generally responsible for servicing the loans. The schemes will invest in \nsecuritised debt of originators with at least investment grade credit rating and established track record. A \ndetailed evaluation of originator is done before the investment is made in securitised debt of any originator \non various parameters given below: \n ● Track record \n The investment in securitised debt is done based on origination and underwriting process and \ncapabilities of the originator, overview of corporate structure, group to which they belong, experience \nof the company in the business & how long they have been in the business, financial condition of the \ncompany, credit rating, past performance of similar pools by the originator, etc. \n● Willingness to pay through credit enhancement facilities etc. \n Credit enhancement is provided by the originator, as indicated by rating agencies, so as to adequately \ncover the defaults and acts as a risk mitigation measure. The size of the credit enhancement as \nindicated by rating agency depends on the originator's track record, past delinquencies, pattern of the \nportfolio & characteristics of the pool vis-a-vis of the portfolio, nature of the asset class. \n● Ability to pay \n The quality of the origination impacts the performance of the underlying asset & thus originators with \nstrong systems and processes in place can eliminate poor quality assets. A robust risk management \nsystem of the originator and availability of MIS reports on timely basis, results in creation of strong \nasset portfolio. \n● Business Risk Assessment \n The business risk assessment of originator / underlying borrower also includes detailed credit \nassessment wherein following factors are also considered: \n  - Outlook for the economy (domestic and global)  \n  - Outlook for the industry  \n  - Company specific factors \n \n \n42  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n In addition, a detailed review and assessment of rating rationale is done along with interactions with \nthe company as well as the rating agency.  All investment in securitised debt is done after taking into \naccount, the Critical Evaluation Parameters (for pool loan and single loan securitisation transactions) \nregarding the originator / underlying issuer as mentioned below: \n● Default track record/ frequent alteration of redemption conditions / covenants \n● High leverage ratios of the ultimate borrower (for si ngle-sell downs) - both on a standalone basis \nas well on a consolidated level/ group level \n● Higher proportion of reschedulement of underlying assets of the pool or loan, as the case may be  \n● Higher proportion of overdue assets of the pool or the underlying loan, as the case may be \n● Poor reputation in market  \n● Insufficient track record of servicing of the pool or the loan, as the case may be. \n3. Risk mitigation strategies for investments with each kind of originator \n Investments are based on assessment o f following parameters, so as to mitigate risk associated with \nsuch investment: \na. Credit quality, size and reach of the originator \nb. Nature of receivables/asset category i.e. cars, construction equipment, commercial vehicles, personal \nloans etc. \nc. Collection process, infrastructure and follow-up mechanism \nd. Quality of MIS \ne. Credit cum liquidity enhancement \nf. Credit appraisal norms of originator \ng. Asset Quality - portfolio delinquency levels \nh. Past performance of rated pools \ni. Pool Characteristics - seasoning, Loan-to-value ratios, geographic diversity etc. \n4. The level of diversification with respect to the underlying assets, and risk mitigation measures for \nless diversified investments \n Diversification of underlying assets is achieved through a) prudent mix of asset categories - i.e. cars  (new, \nused), commercial vehicles, construction equipment, unsecured loans to individuals or small & medium \nenterprises b) total number of contracts in a pool c) average ticket size of loans and d) geographical \ndistribution. \n Risk mitigation measures for less diversified investments in pools is accomplished through the size of \ncredit enhancement, seasoning or loan to value ratios.    \n Illustrative framework, which will be applied while evaluating investment decision  relating to a pool \nsecuritisation transaction: \nCharacteristics/ \nType of Pool \nMortgage \nLoan \nCommercial \nVehicle and \nConstruction \nEquipment  \nCar 2 \nwheelers \nMicro \nFinance \nPools \nPersonal \nLoans \nSingle  \nSell \nDowns \nOthers \nApproximate \nAverage maturity (in \nMonths) \nNA 12-60 months 12-60 \nmonths \n8-40 \nmonths NA NA \nRefer \nNote A \nRefer \nNote B \nCollateral margin \n(including cash, \nguarantees, excess \ninterest spread, \nsubordinate tranche) \nNA 5-20% 4-15% 4-15% NA NA \n \n \n43  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nAverage Loan to \nValue Ratio NA 80-95% 70-90% 70-95% NA NA \nAverage seasoning \nof the Pool NA 3-8 months 3-8 \nmonths \n2-5 \nmonths NA NA \nMaximum single \nexposure range  NA 3-7% \nNA \n(Retail \npool) \nNA \n(Retail \nPool) \nNA NA \nAverage single \nexposure range % NA 1-5% 0-1% 0-1% NA NA \nNA - Not Applicable \nInformation in the table above is based on current scenario and is subject to change depending upon the \nchange in related factors. \n \nNotes: \nA. In case of securitised  debt with underlying being single loan, the investment limit applicable to the \nunderlying borrower is considered. \nB. Other investment will be decided on a case to case basis. \n In case of asset backed pools (ABS), evaluation of the pool assets is done considering the following \nfactors: (Refer the table above which illustrates the averages of parameters considered while selecting \nthe pool) \n• Size of the loan \n• Average original maturity of the pool \n• Loan to Value Ratio \n• Average seasoning of the pool \n• Default rate distribution \n• Geographical Distribution \n• Credit enhancement facility  \n• Liquid facility \n• Structure of the pool \n \n5. Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation \n The illustrative average seasoning of the debt by originator prior to securitisation is given above in table \n(Refer Point 4).  \n Minimum retention period of the debt by originator prior to securitisation in the case of asset pools is in \nthe form of seasoning of loans to various asset classes (cars, commerc ial vehicles, etc.) and generally \nvaries from one month to six months depending on the nature of asset. \n6. Minimum retention percentage by originator of debts to be securitised \n While minimum retention percentage by originator is not prescribed, any amount retained by the originator \nthrough subordination is viewed positively at the time of making investment and generally varies from 5% \nto 10%. \n7. The mechanism to tackle conflict of interest when the mutual fund invests in securitised debt of \nan originator and the originator in turn makes investments in that particular scheme of the fund \n \n \n44  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n All proposals for investment in securitised debt are evaluated by the credit analyst based on several \nparameters such as nature of underlying asset category, pool characteristics, asset quality, credit rating \nof the securitisation transaction, and credit cum liquidity enhancement available.  Investment in securitised \ndebt in any scheme is made by the respective fund manager in line with the investment objective of that \nscheme.    \n8. The resources and mechanism of individual risk assessment with the AMC for monitoring \ninvestment in securitised debt (in general) \n Investment in securitised  debt is monitored regularly with regards to its performance on various \nparameters such as collection efficiency, delinquencies, prepayments and utilization of credit \nenhancement. Information on these parameters is available through monthly reports from Pool Trustees \nand through information disseminated by the rating agencies. Monthly performance report is released by \nthe credit analyst to the fund management team and the fund management team periodically reviews the \nsame. \n \nTrading in Derivatives \n•  The Scheme may take derivatives position based on the opportunities available subject to the guidelines \nprovided by SEBI from time to time and in line with the overall investment objective of the Scheme.  \n•  The Scheme intends to use derivatives mainly for the purpose of hedging and portfolio balancing. Losses \nmay arise as a result of using derivatives, but these are likely to be compensated by the gains on the \nunderlying cash instruments held by the Scheme.  \n•  The Scheme may take position in derivative instruments like Futures, Options, and such other derivative \ninstruments as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time. \n \nExposure to Derivatives \nThe exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by SEBI vide its clause 12.25 of \nMaster Circular and as amended from time to time are as follows: \nPosition Limits  \nThe position limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clause 12.25 of the Master \nCircular read with SEBI circular No.  SEBI/HO/MRD/MRD-PoD-2/P/CIR/2024/140 dated October 15, 2024 \nand SEBI circular No. SEBI/HO/MRD/TPD-1/P/CIR/2025/79 dated May 29, 2025 are as follows: \ni. Position limit for Mutual Funds in index options contracts \na) The Mutual Fund position limit in all index options contracts at PAN level shall be as follows: \ni. Net end of day FutEq OI limit for options to be ₹1,500 cr. and  \nii. Gross end of day FutEq OI to be ₹10,000 cr. (i.e. neither gross long FutEq OI nor gross short \nFutEq OI shall exceed ₹10,000 cr.)  \nThis limit would be applicable on open positions in all option s contracts on a particular \nUnderlying Index.  \n \nii.  Position limit for Mutual Funds in index futures contracts \na) The Mutual Fund position limit in all index futures contracts on a particular Underlying Index shall be \nhigher of 15% of futures OI for that index or ₹500 cr. \nb) This limit would be applicable on open positions in all futures contracts on a particular Underlying \nIndex. \nc) The above stated position limits for index futures would be measured on gross notional basis. The \nposition limits shall be computed on a gross basis at the level of MF and on a net basis at the level \nof schemes of MF.  \nFormulation of Open Interest (OI) \n \n \n45  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \ni. OI in derivatives shall be measured at portfolio level by computing the net Delta adjusted open \npositions across futures and options for an underlying at a given point in time. Delta denotes \nsensitivity of price movement of derivative position with respect  to that of the underlying. \nAccordingly, long futures have a delta of +1 times notional. For options, delta will range between \n0 and +1 times notional for long calls and between 0 and –1 times notional for long puts. In case \nof short options position, effective delta for short calls is negative and that of short put is positive. \nii. Gross addition of such net Future Equivalent Open Interest (FutEq OI) across all the Unique Client \nCodes would form the FutEq OI for the Stock/Index derivatives.   \n \niii. Additional position limit for hedging \nIn addition to the position limits at point (i) and (ii) above, Mutual Funds may take exposure in equity \nindex derivatives subject to the following limits: \n1. Aggregate short positions in index derivatives (short futures, short calls and  long puts) shall not \nexceed (FutEq terms for Index options and gross notional terms for Index futures) the Mutual \nFund’s holding of stocks. \n2. Aggregate long positions in index derivatives (long futures, long calls and short puts) shall not \nexceed (FutEq ter ms for Index options and gross notional terms for Index futures) the Mutual \nFund’s holding of cash and cash equivalent, government securities, T -Bills and similar \ninstruments. \n \niv. Position limit for Mutual Funds for stock based derivative contracts \nThe Mutual Fund position limit in a derivative contract on a particular underlying stock, i.e. stock \noption contracts and stock futures contracts will be as follows: \n \nThe combined futures and options position limit shall be 30% of the applicable Market Wide Position \nLimit (MWPL).  \n \nv. Position limit for each Scheme of a Mutual Fund \n              The Scheme-wise position limit requirements shall be: \n1. The gross open positions across all derivative contracts on a particular underlying s tock should \nnot exceed the higher of: \n1% of the free float market capitalization (in terms of number of shares).  \nor \n5% of the open interest in the derivative contracts on a particular underlying stock (in terms of \nnumber of contracts).  \n2. These position limits would be applicable on the combined position in all derivative contracts on \nan underlying stock at a Stock exchange. \n \n3. For index based contracts, Mutual Funds shall disclose the total open interest held by its Scheme \nor all Schemes put together in a particular Underlying Index, if such open interest equals to or \nexceeds 15% of the open interest of all derivative contracts on that Underlying Index. \n \n Exposure Limits \nThe exposure limits for trading in derivatives by Mutual Funds specified by clauses 12.24 and 12.25 \nof Master Circular, are as follows: \n1. The cumulative gross exposure through equity, debt, derivative positions (including fixed income \nderivatives), repo transactions in corporate debt securities, credit default swaps, Real Estate \nInvestment Trusts (REITs), Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs), other permitted \nsecurities/assets and such other securities/assets as may be permitted by SEBI from time to time \nshall not exceed 100% of the net assets of the scheme.

Mutual Funds shall not write options or purchase instruments with em -bedded written options \n(except for exposure on account of call option written under the covered call strategy, if permitted \nunder the Scheme). \n \n3. The total exposure related to option premium paid must n ot exceed 20% of the net assets of the \nscheme.  \n \n4. Cash or cash equivalents i.e. Government Securities, T-Bills and Repo on Government Securities \nhaving residual maturity of less than 91 days may be treated as not creating any exposure.  \n \n5. Exposure due to hedging positions may not be included in the above mentioned limits subject to \nthe following:  \na) Hedging positions are the derivative positions that reduce possible losses on an existing \nposition in securities and till the existing position remains.  \nb) Hedging positions cannot be taken for existing derivative positions. Exposure due to such \npositions shall have to be added and treated under limits mentioned in Point 1.  \nc) Any derivative instrument used to hedge has the same underlying security as the exist ing \nposition being hedged.  \nd) The quantity of underlying associated with the derivative position taken for hedging \npurposes does not exceed the quantity of the existing position against which hedge has \nbeen taken. \n \n6. (a) Mutual Funds may enter into plain vanilla Interest Rate Swaps (IRS) for hedging purposes. The \nvalue of the notional principal in such cases must not exceed the value of respective existing assets \nbeing hedged by the scheme.  \n(b) In case of participation in IRS is through over the counter transactions, the counter party has to \nbe an entity recognized as a market maker by RBI and exposure to a single counterparty in such \ntransactions should not exceed 10% of the net assets of the scheme. However, if mutual funds are \ntransacting in IRS through an e lectronic trading platform offered by the Clearing Corporation of \nIndia Ltd. (CCIL) and CCIL is the central counterparty for such transactions guaranteeing \nsettlement, the single counterparty limit of 10% shall not be applicable.  \n \n7. Exposure due to derivati ve positions taken for hedging purposes in excess of the underlying \nposition against which the hedging position has been taken, shall be treated under the limits \nmentioned in point 1. \n \n8. Definition of Exposure in case of Derivative Positions \nEach position taken in derivatives shall have an associated exposure as defined under. Exposure \nis the maximum possible loss that may occur on a position. However, certain derivative positions \nmay theoretically have unlimited possible loss. Exposure in derivative positions shall be computed \nas follows:  \n  \nPosition Exposure \n \n \n47  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nLong Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts \nShort Future Futures Price * Lot Size * Number of Contracts \nOption Bought Option Premium Paid * Lot Size * Number of Contracts \n \n     Exposure limits on Credit Default Swaps (CDS) \nExposure through CDS (Notional amount of both CDS bought and sold) shall not exceed 10% of AUM of \nscheme and shall be within the overall limit of derivatives. \nExposure limits on Interest Rate Futures (IRF) \nThe exposure limits for trading in Interest Rate Futures (IRFs) by Mutual Funds specified by clause  \n12.25.9 of Master Circular are as follows: \ni.  To reduce interest rate risk in a debt portfolio, mutual funds may hedge the portfolio or part of the \nportfolio (including one or more securities) on weighted average modified duration basis by using \nInterest Rate Futures (IRFs). The maximum extent of short position that may be taken in IRFs to hedge \ninterest rate risk of the portfolio or part of the portfolio, is as per the formula given below: \n(Portfolio Modified Duration* \nMarket Value of the Portfolio) \n(Futures Modified Duration *Futures Price/PAR) \nii.  In case the IRF used for hedging the interest rate risk has different underlying security(s) than the \nexisting position being hedged, it would result in imperfect hedging. \niii.  Imperfect hedging using IRFs may be considered to be exempted from the gross exposure, upto \nmaximum of 20% of the net assets of the scheme, subject to the following: \na)  Exposure to IRFs is created only for hedging the interest rate risk based on the weighted average \nmodified duration of the bond portfolio or part of the portfolio. \nb)  Mutual Funds are permitted to resort to imperfect hedging, without it being considered under the \ngross exposure limits, if and only if, the correlation between the portfolio or part of the portfolio \n(excluding the hedged portions, if any) and the IRF is atleast 0.9 at the time of initiation of hedge. \nIn case of any subsequent deviation from the correlation c riteria, the same may be rebalanced \nwithin 5 working days and if not rebalanced within the timeline, the derivative positions created for \nhedging shall be considered under the gross exposure computed in terms of clause  12.24.1 of \nMaster Circular. The correlation should be calculated for a period of last 90 days. \n Explanation: If the fund manager intends to do imperfect hedging upto 15% of the portfolio using \nIRFs on weighted average modified duration basis, either of the following conditions need to be \ncomplied with: \ni.  The correlation for past 90 days between the portfolio and the IRF is at least 0.9 or  \nii.  The correlation for past 90 days between the part of the portfolio (excluding the hedged \nportions, if any) i.e. at least 15% of the net asset of the scheme (including one or more \nsecurities) and the IRF is at least 0.9. \nc)  At no point of time, the net modified duration of part of the portfolio being hedged should be \nnegative. \n \n \n48  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nd)  The portion of imperfect hedging in excess of 20% of the net assets of t he scheme should be \nconsidered as creating exposure and shall be included in the computation of gross exposure in \nterms of clause 12.24.1 of Master Circular. \n \n• Debt Market In India \nThe instruments available in Indian Debt Market are classified into two categories, namely Government and \nNon - Government debt. The instruments available in these categories include: \nA] Government Debt \n Central Government Debt \n Treasury Bills \n Dated Government Securities \n – Coupon Bearing Bonds \n – Floating Rate Bonds \n – Zero Coupon Bonds \n State Government Debt \n – State Government Loans \n – Coupon Bearing Bonds \nB] Non-Government Debt \n Instruments issued by Government Agencies and other Statutory Bodies \n \n  Government Guaranteed Bonds \n \n  PSU Bonds \n Instruments issued by Public Sector Undertakings \n \n  Commercial Paper \n \n  PSU Bonds \n \n  Fixed Coupon Bonds \n \n  Floating Rate Bonds \n \n  Zero Coupon Bonds \n Instruments issued by Banks and Development Financial Institutions \n \n  Certificates of Deposit \n \n  Promissory Notes \n \n  Bonds \n \n  Fixed Coupon Bonds \n \n  Floating Rate Bonds \n \n  Zero Coupon Bonds \n Instruments issued by Corporate Bodies \n \n  Commercial Paper \n \n  Non-Convertible Debentures \n \n  Fixed Coupon Debentures \n \n  Floating Rate Debentures \n \n  Zero Coupon Debentures \n \n  Pass Through Securities \n \n \n49  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nActivity in the Primary and Secondary Market is dominated by Central Government Securities including \nTreasury Bills. These instruments comprise close to 60% of all outstanding debt and more than 75% of the \ndaily trading volume on the Wholesale Debt Market Segment of the National Stock Exchange of India Limited. \nIn the money market, activity levels of the Government and Non - Government Debt vary from time to time. \nInstruments that comprise a major portion of money market activity include, \n Overnight Call \n Repo/Reverse Repo Agreements  \n Tri-party Repos on Government securities or treasury bills (TREPS) \n Treasury Bills \n Government Securities with a residual maturity of < 1 year \n Commercial Paper \n Certificates of Deposit \n Bills Rediscounting Scheme \nThough not strictly classified as Money Market Instruments, PSU/ DFI / Corporate paper with a residual \nmaturity of < 1 year, are actively traded and offer a viable investment option. \nThe following table gives approximate yields prevailing during the month ended  September 30, 2025 on \nsome of the instruments. These yields are indicative and do not indicate yields that may be obtained in future \nas interest rates keep changing consequent to changes in macro economic conditions and RBI policy. \n \nInstrument Yield Range  \n(% per annum) \nInter bank Call Money  4.95 - 5.40 \n91 Day Treasury Bill  5.40 - 5.50 \n364 Day Treasury Bill   5.56 - 5.65 \nA1 + Commercial Paper 90 Days 5.78 - 5.91 \n5 Year Government of India Security 6.13 - 6.30 \n10 Year Government of India Security 6.47 - 6.59 \n15 Year Government of India Security   6.807 - 6.985 \n1 Year Corporate Bond - AAA Rated 6.60 - 6.69 \n3 Year Corporate Bond - AAA Rated 6.68 - 6.99 \n5 Year Corporate Bond - AAA Rated 6.65 - 7.08 \nSource: Bloomberg \n \nThese yields are indicative and do not indicate yields that may be obtained in future as interest rates keep \nchanging consequent to changes in macro economic conditions and RBI policy. The price and yield on various \ndebt instruments fluctuate from time to time depending upon the macro economic situation, inflation rate, \noverall liquidity position, foreign exchange scenario etc. Also, the price and yield vary according to maturity \nprofile, credit risk etc. \nGenerally, for instruments issued by a non -Government entity (corporate / PSU bonds), the yield is higher \nthan the yield on a Government Security with corresponding maturity. The difference, known as credit spread, \ndepends on the credit rating of the entity. \n \n \n50  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n \n• Overseas Debt Market \nThe nature and number of debt instruments available in international debt markets is very wide. In terms of \ndiverse instruments as well as liquidity, overseas debt markets offer great depth and are extremely well \ndeveloped. \nInvestment in international debt greatly expands the universe of top quality debt, which is no longer restricted \nto the limited papers available in the domestic debt market. The higher rated overseas sovereign, quasi -\ngovernment and corporate debt offer lower default risk in addition to offering a high degree of liquidity since \nthese are traded across major international markets. Investments in rated international debt offer multiple \nbenefits of risk reduction, a much wider universe of top quality debt and also potential gains from currency \nmovements. \nInvestments in international markets are most often in U.S. dollars, though the Euro, Pound Sterling and the \nYen are also major currencies. Though this market is geographically well spread across global financial \ncentres, the markets in the U.S., European Union and Lo ndon offer the most liquidity and depth of \ninstruments. \nBesides factors specific to the country / issuer, international bond prices are influenced to a large extent by \na number of other factors; chief among these are the international economic outlook, cha nges in interest \nrates in major economies, trading volumes in overseas markets, cross currency movements among major \ncurrencies, rating changes of countries / corporations and major political changes globally. \nThe approximate yields to maturity in the US Bond Market are as follows: \nMaturity US Treasury yields (%) \n(As at September 30, 2025) \n3 months 4.02 \n6 months 3.83 \n2 years 3.60 \n3 years 3.61 \n5 years 3.74 \n10 years 4.16 \nSource : H.15, Federal Reserve Statistical Release \n \nMaturity US AA \nCorporate Bond yields rate* (%) \n(As at September 30, 2025) \n1 year 3.8807 \n2 years 3.7992 \n5 years 4.0651 \n10 years 4.6439 \n(Source - Bloomberg) \n* Composite curve includes AA-, AA, AA+ as US AAA curve has been discontinued. \n \n \n \n51  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nB.

The restriction \non Redemption (including switch -out) shall be applicable where the \nRedemption (including switch-out) request is for a value above Rs. 2,00,000/- \n(Rupees Two Lakhs). Further, no restriction shall be applicable to the \nRedemption / switch-out request upto Rs. 2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lakhs). It \nis further clarified that, in case of redemption request beyond Rs. 2,00,000/ - \n \n \n62  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \n(Rupees Two Lakhs), no restriction shall be applicable on first Rs. 2,00,000/- \n(Rupees Two Lakhs). \nThe Trustee / AMC reserves the right to restrict Redemption or suspend \nRedemption of the Units in the Scheme of the Fund on account of \ncircumstances leading to a systemic crisis or event(s) that severely constrict \nmarket liquidity or the efficient functioning of the markets. A list of such \ncircumstances under which the restriction on Redemption or suspension of \nRedemption of the Units in the Scheme of the Fund may be imposed are as \nfollows: \n1. Liquidity issues- when market at large becomes illiquid affecting almost \nall securities rather than any issuer specific security; or \n2. Market failures / Exchange closures; or \n3. Operational issues; or \n4. If so directed by SEBI. \nIt is clarified that since the occurrence of the abovementioned eventualities \nhave the ability to impact the overall market and liquidity situation, the same \nmay result in exceptionally large number of Redemption requests being made \nand in such a situation the indicative timelines, if any mentioned by the Fund \nin the scheme offering documents, for processing of requests for Redemption \nmay not be applicable. \nAny restriction on Redemption or suspension of Redemption of the Units in \nthe Scheme(s) of the Mutual Fund shall be made applicable only after specific \napproval of the Board of Directors of the AMC and Trustee Company and \nthereafter, immediately informing the same to SEBI. \nThe AMC / Trustee reserves the right to change / modify the provisions of \nright to restrict Redemption and / or suspend Redemption of the Units in the \nScheme of the Fund. \nCut off timing for \nsubscriptions/ \nredemptions/ switches  \nThis is the time before \nwhich your \napplication (complete in all \nrespects) should reach the \nofficial points of \nacceptance. \nThe below cut -off timings and applicability of NAV shall be applicable in \nrespect of valid applications received at the Official Point(s) of Acceptance \non a Business Day: \nA]  For Purchase (including switch-in) of any amount: \n● In respect of valid applications received upto 3.00 p.m. and where the \nfunds for the entire amount are available for utilization before the cut-\noff time i.e. credited to the bank account of the Scheme before the cut-\noff time - the closing NAV of the day shall be applicable. \n● In respect of valid applications received after 3.00 p.m. and where the \nfunds for the entire amount are credited to the bank account of the \nScheme either at any time on the same day or before the cut-off time \nof the next Business Day i.e. available for utilization before the cut-off \ntime of the next Business Day - the closing NAV of the next Business \nDay shall be applicable. \n● Irrespective of the time of receipt of application, where the funds for \nthe entire amount are credited to the bank  account of the Scheme \nbefore the cut-off time on any subsequent Business Day i.e. available \nfor utilization before the cut-off time on any subsequent Business Day \n- the closing NAV of such subsequent Business Day shall be \napplicable. \n \n \n63  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nB]  For Switch-ins of any amount: \nFor determining the applicable NAV, the following shall be ensured: \n● Application for switch-in is received before the applicable cut-off time. \n● Funds for the entire amount of subscription/purchase as per the \nswitch-in request are credited to  the bank account of the Scheme \nbefore the cut-off time. \n● The funds are available for utilization before the cut-off time. \n● In case of ‘switch’ transactions from one scheme to another, the \nallocation shall be in line with redemption payouts. \n In case of switches, the request should be received on a day which is \na Business Day for the Switch-out scheme. Redemption for switch-out \nshall be processed at the applicable NAV as per cut-off timing. Switch-\nin will be processed at the Applicable NAV (on a Business Day) based \non realization of funds as per the redemption pay -out cycle for the \nswitch-out scheme. \n For investments through systematic investment routes such as Systematic \nInvestment Plans (SIP), Flex SIP, Systematic Transfer Plans (STP), Flex-\nSTP, Swing STP, Transfer of Income Distribution cum Capital Withdrawal \n(IDCW) Plan facility (TIP), etc. the units will be allotted as per the closing \nNAV of the day on which the funds are available for utilization by the Target \nScheme irrespective of the installment date of the SIP, STP or record date \nof IDCW etc.  \n While the AMC will endeavour to deposit the payment instruments \naccompanying investment application submitted to it with its bank \nexpeditiously, it shall not be liable for delay in realization of funds on \naccount of factors beyond its control such as clearing / settlement cycles \nof the banks. \n Since different payment modes have different settlement cycles including \nelectronic transactions (as per arrangements with Payment Aggregators / \nBanks / Exchanges etc),  it may happen that the investor's account is \ndebited, but the money is not credited within cut-off time on the same date \nto the Scheme's bank account, leading to a gap / delay in Unit allotment. \nInvestors are therefore urged to use the most efficient electronic payment \nmodes to avoid delays in realization of funds and consequently in Unit \nallotment. \n \nC]  For Redemption (including switch-out) applications \n ● In respect of valid applications received upto 3 p.m. on a Business \nDay by the Fund, same day's closing NAV shall be applicable. \n ● In respect of valid applications received after 3 p.m. on a Business \nDay by the Fund, the closing NAV of the next Business Day shall be \napplicable. \n \nTransactions through online facilities / electronic modes: \nThe time of transaction done through various online facilities / electronic \nmodes offered by the AMC, for the purpose of determining the applicability of \n \n \n64  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nNAV, would be the time when the request for purchase / sale / switch of units \nis received in the servers of AMC/RTA. \nThe AMC has the right to amend cut off timings subject to SEBI (MF) \nRegulations for the smooth and efficient functioning of the Scheme. \nMinimum amount for \npurchase/redemption/sw\nitches \nMinimum amount for Purchase/Redemption (including Switch-in/out):  \nFor details refer section 'Highlights / Summary of the Scheme'. \nThe request for minimum amount /units for redemption / switch -out of Units \nunder each plan / option would be Rs. 100 and multiples of Re. 1/- thereafter. \nNote: Provisions for minimu m amount of purchase / redemptions are not \napplicable in case of mandatory investments by the Designated Employees \nof the AMC in accordance with clause 6.10 of Master Circular.  \nThere will be no minimum redemption criterion for Unit based redemption. \nThe Redemption / Switch -out would be permitted to the extent of credit \nbalance in the Unit holder’s account of the Plan(s) / Option(s) of the Scheme \n(subject to completion of Lock -in period or release of pledge / lien or other \nencumbrances). \nThe Redemption / Switch-out request can be made by specifying the rupee \namount or by specifying the number of Units of the respective Plan(s) / \nOption(s) to be redeemed. In case a Redemption / Switch -out request \nreceived is for both, a specified rupee amount and a specified number of Units \nof the respective Plan(s)/ Option(s), the specified number of Units will be \nconsidered the definitive request. \nIn case the value / number of available units held in the Unit holder’s folio / \naccount under the Plan / Option of the Scheme is less than the amount / \nnumber of units specified in the redemption / switchout request, then the \ntransaction shall be treated as an ‘all units’ redemption and the entire balance \nof available Units in the folio / account of the Unit holder under the stated Plan \n/ Option of the Scheme shall be redeemed. \nAccounts Statements The AMC shall send an allotment confirmation specifying the units allotted by \nway of email and/or SMS within 5 working days of receipt of valid \napplication/transaction to the Unit holders registered e -mail address and/ or \nmobile number (whether units are held in demat mode or in account \nstatement form). \nA Consolid ated Account Statement (CAS) detailing all the transactions \nacross all mutual funds and holdings at the end of the month shall be sent to \nthe Unit holders in whose folio(s) transaction(s) have taken place during the \nmonth on registered email address on or before 12th of the succeeding month \nand by 15th of the succeeding month for those who have opted for physical \ncopy. \nHalf-yearly CAS shall be issued to all investors providing the prescribed \ndetails across all schemes of mutual funds and securities held in \ndematerialized form across demat accounts, if applicable, at the end of every \nsix months (i.e. September/ March) on or before 18th day of succeeding \n \n \n65  \n \n               \nHDFC Large Cap Fund-SID \n \nmonth on registered email address and 21st day of succeeding month \nthrough physical copy for those who do not have registered email addresses. \nFor further details, refer SAI. \nDividend/ IDCW The payment of dividend/IDCW to the unitholders shall be made within seven \nworking days from the record date  or as per timelines prescribed by SEBI/ \nAMFI from time to time. \nRedemption The redemption or repurchase proceeds shall be dispatched to the \nunitholders within three working days from the date of redemption or \nrepurchase or such other timelines as may be specified by SEBI / AMFI from \ntime to time in case of exceptional circumstances or otherwise. \nFor details refer para 14.1.3 of Master Circular. \nBank Mandate BANK DETAILS \nIn order to protect the interest of Unit holders from fraudulent encashment of \nredemption / IDCW cheques, SEBI has made it mandatory for in vestors to \nprovide their bank details viz. name of bank, branch, address, account type \nand number, etc. to the Mutual Fund. Payment will be made only in the Bank \nAccount registered with the Mutual Fund. In case of units held in demat mode, \npayment will be made to the bank account linked to the demat account. The \nbank account registered in the folio of a minor should be that of the minor or \nshould be a joint account of the minor with the guardian. Applications without \ncomplete bank details shall be rejected. The AMC will not be responsible for \nany loss arising out of fraudulent encashment of cheques/ warrants and/ or \nany delay/ loss in transit. \n \n● Multiple Bank Accounts Registration \nThe AMC/ Mutual Fund provides a facility to the investors to register multiple \nbank accounts (currently upto 5 for Individuals and 10 for Non - Individuals) \nfor receiving redemption/ IDCW proceeds etc. by providing necessary \ndocuments. Investors must specify any one account as the \"Default Bank \nAccount\".  \n● Change in Bank Account \nFor investors holding units in demat mode, the procedure for change in bank \ndetails would be as determined by the depository participant. \nFor investors holding units in non-demat mode, the Unit holders may change \ntheir bank details re gistered with the Mutual Fund by submitting 'Multiple \nBank Account Registration Form' or a standalone separate Change of Bank \nDetails Form. \nDelay in payment of \nredemption /repurchase \nproceeds/dividend \nThe AMC shall be liable to pay interest to the Unit holders at 15%  or such \nother rate as may be prescribed by SEBI from time to time,  in case the \nredemption/ repurchase / IDCW  proceeds are not transferred within the \nprescribed timeline.
